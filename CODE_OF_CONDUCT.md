# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **@forgepack** packages, pledge to make participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing an open, welcoming, and respectful environment for all contributors—whether they are reporting bugs, submitting pull requests, suggesting new features, improving documentation, or engaging in discussions about our libraries and tools.

They have the right and obligation to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers commit to applying these guidelines fairly and consistently across all @forgepack projects.
